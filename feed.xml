From high school physics, the <em>open circuit voltage</em> is supposed to be the voltage at infinite large load, which means the current density is approximately zero. I previously thinks that the OCV may related to current density, diffusion, kinetics. However, I misunderstood the concept of OCV it is not working. Ideally there is no current, consequently no diffusion and kinetics problems. It should be more stable then I had thought.</p> <p>Nonetheless, it is by no means stationary. From Nernst equation:</p> <p>\(\Delta G = -zFE\) \(E = E^\circ - \frac{RT}{zF}ln(Q_r)\)</p> <p>with the ongoing of reaction the activity is also changed. OK, one may argue that in a <s> rockin' roll </s> the <em>rocking chair battery(RCB)</em> the solvent may not change concentration just like their famous relative <em>Lithium-ion batteries</em>. However, I still thinks SEI formation, surface reshaping, and other side effects may drive the OCV away when using the battery. So here we introduce an important concept called <em>State of Charge(SOC)</em>. This should actually mean the charge status, like SOC = 100% means fully charged. Just like the worrying battery percentage thing in your cellphone. OK, I have to admit this really confused me for several days when I first get to know the concept, because nobody told me the UNIT of SOC(unit of 1). I find people directly use the voltage in a capacitor to be the SOC and this works because ideal capacitors have a linear relationship between voltage and remaining charges.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="small-talks">Small talks</h2> <blockquote> <p>At winter, the electric car can be driven for less distance not only because the inner resitance of bateries become larger, but also because there is 7% larger air resistance at 5 C compared with 25 C. —My kindly lecturer of C26</p> </blockquote>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="battery-study"/><category term="batteries"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[First blog!]]></summary></entry></feed>
