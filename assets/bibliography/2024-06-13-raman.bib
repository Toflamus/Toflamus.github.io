  title = {Rational design of anti-freezing electrolytes for extremely low-temperature aqueous batteries},
  journal = {Nature Energy},
  abstract = {Designing anti-freezing electrolytes through choosing suitable H2O–solute systems is crucial for low-temperature aqueous batteries (LTABs). However, the lack of an effective guideline for choosing H2O–solute systems based on decisive temperature-limiting factors hinders the development of LTABs. Here we identified two decisive factors: thermodynamic eutectic temperature (Te) and kinetic glass-transition temperature (Tg), with Tg being applicable for LTABs only when H2O–solute systems have strong super-cooling ability. We proposed a general strategy wherein low-Te and strong-super-cooling ability electrolytes can be realized by creating multiple-solute systems via introducing assisted salts with high ionic-potential cations (for example, Al3+, Ca2+) or cosolvents with high donor numbers (for example, ethylene glycol). As a demonstration in Na-based systems, we designed electrolytes with ultralow Te (−53.5 to −72.6 °C) and Tg (−86.1 to −117.1 °C), showcasing battery performances including 80 Wh kg−1 and 5,000 cycles at 25 °C, and 12.5 Wh kg−1 at −85 °C. The work provides effective guidelines for the design of anti-freezing electrolytes for extremely low-temperature applications.},

ABSTRACT = {Ionic perturbation of water has important implications in various chemical, biological and environmental processes. Previous studies revealed the structural and dynamical perturbation of water in the presence of ions, mainly with concentrated electrolyte solutions having significant interionic interactions. These investigations highlighted the need of selective extraction of the hydration shell water from a dilute electrolyte solution that is largely free from interionic interactions. Double-difference infrared (DDIR) and Raman multivariate curve resolution (Raman-MCR), as well as MD simulation, provided valuable insight in this direction, suggesting that the perturbed water mainly resides in the immediate vicinity of the ion, called the hydration shell. Recently, we have introduced Raman difference spectroscopy with simultaneous curve fitting (Raman-DS-SCF) analysis that can quantitatively extract the vibrational response of the perturbed water pertaining to the hydration shell of fully hydrated ions/solute. The DS-SCF analysis revealed novel hydrogen-bond (H-bond) structural features of hydration water, such as the existence of extremely weakly interacting water–OH (νmax ~ 3600 cm−1) in the hydration shell of high-charge-density metal ions (Mg2+, Dy3+). In addition, Raman-DS-SCF retrieves the vibrational response of the shared water in the water–shared-ion pair (WSIP), which is different from the hydration shell water of either the interacting cation and anion. Herein, we discuss the perturbation of water H-bonding in the immediate vicinity of cation, anion, zwitterion and hydrophobes and also the inter-ionic interactions, with a focus on the recent results from our laboratory using Raman-DS-SCF spectroscopy.},
