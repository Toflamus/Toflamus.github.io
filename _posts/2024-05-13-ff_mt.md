## Basic concepts and definitions

Before we start let just review some concepts:  

There are 2 kinds of diffusion we consider in the system.  

***molecular diffusion*** by **random and spontaneous microscpoic movement of molecules** of thermo motion occurs in fluid that is **stagnant or in laminar motion**. The process is **slow**.  
***eddy diffusion*** by **random macroscopic fluid motion** occurs when **fluid mixing in a turbulent motion**. This is a fast process.  

Also, mass transfer contains convection.*convection* by bulk flow.  

$J$: molar diffusion flux density  
$N$：molar flux density  

## Fick's law and mass balance

To start with, if we do not go from *Maxwell-Stefan's theory* everything starts with 2 basic thoughts. We use different forms of the 2 equations here and there. Please remember this in your mind **Mass transport analogues to heat transfer** in many ways!  

### Fick's law and mutual diffusivity

We just assume that a driving force result in a linear responding. Which is exactly the *Fick's law*  
\begin{equation}  
J_A = -D_{AB}\nabla c_A
\end{equation}  

$$J_B = -D_{BA}\nabla c_B$$  
$$D_{AB} = D_{BA}$$  

$D$ is in $m^2/s$, $c$ is in $[anyunit]/m^3$  

There are other forms of Fick's law:  
$$J_A = -cD_{AB}\nabla x_A$$
or  
$$j_A = -\rho D_{AB}\nabla w_A$$
$w_A$ is the mass fraction of A. $\rho * w = kg/m^3* kg(A)/kg(solution) = m_A/v_{solution}$  

### Mass balance in a control volume

Consider a classic mass balance problem in a controled volume.  

$$\frac{\partial c_A}{\partial t} = \nabla$$

### Fick's second law

Combine the first 2 equations, we have the Fick's second law:  

$\frac{\partial c_A}{\partial t} = - \nabla^2 c_A$  

### Species velocities

$\mathcal Def$: molar avearge mixture velocity  

$$v_M = \frac{N}{c} = \frac{\sum N_i}{c}$$

$\mathcal Def$: velocity of species i in terms of $N_i$

$$v_M = \frac{N_i}{c_i}$$

Thus  

$v_M =  \frac{\sum N_i}{c} = \sum\frac{c_i}{c}\frac{ N_i}{c_i} = \sum x_i v_i$

$\mathcal Def$:  Diffusion velocity  

$$v_{i_D} = \frac{J_i}{c_i} = \frac{N_i - N_{i,conv}}{c_i} = v_i - v_M$$  

Note: $N_{i,conv} \neq N$

$$v_i = v_M+v_{i_D}$$  
$$N_i = c_iv_M+c_iv_{i_D}$$  

For a binary system,  

$$N_A = \frac{n_A}{A} = x_AN- cD_{AB}\nabla{x_A}$$
